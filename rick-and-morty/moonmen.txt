The world can be one together
Cosmos without hatred
Stars like diamonds in your eyes
The ground can be space (space, space, space, space)
With feet marching towards a peaceful sky
All the Moonmen want things their way
But we make sure they see the sun
Goodbye, Moonmen
We say goodbye, Moonmen
Goodbye, Moonmen
Goodbye, Moonmen
Oh, goodbye

Cosmos without hatred
Diamond stars of cosmic light
Quasars shine through endless nights
And everything is one in the beauty 
And now we say goodbye, Moonmen
We say goodbye, Moonmen 
Goodbye, Moonmen
Goodbye, Moonmen
Oh, goodbye


[Rick]
Shut the fuck up about Moonmen!
